Analyzing a spam text dataset involves cleaning the data, separating messages into spam and non-spam, visualizing the results, and training Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost models with TF-IDF vectorization. The performance of each model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, F1 score, and recall to measure how well they detect spam.
